# CollegeSynx Admin Portal

A comprehensive administrative mobile application designed for educational institutions to manage student discipline, gate security, and activity tracking. This application connects Faculty, Security, and Admin staff in a unified ecosystem.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. **Authentication & Role-Based Access**

- **Secure Login**: Email and password authentication via Firebase.
- **Role Management**: Distinct interfaces and permissions for:
  - **Admin/Principal/HOD**: Full oversight and global activity feed.
  - **Faculty**: Ability to report disciplinary cases and view their history.
  - **Security**: Gate scanning, late entry marking, and verification tools.
  - **Student**: Read-only view of their profile and status (if applicable).

### 2. **Smart ID Scanner (Security Module)**

- **QR/Barcode Scanning**: Instantly identifies students using their ID card barcodes.
- **Real-time Validation**: Fetches live student data including:
  - **Photo & Profile Details** (fetched from secure storage).
  - **Academic Branch & Year**.
  - **Hosteller/Day Scholar Status** (Critical for gate exit permissions).
- **Quick Actions**:
  - **Mark Late Entry**: One-tap action to log late arrivals, automatically deducting credits.

### 3. **Discipline & Credit System**

A complete digital merit system to track student conduct.

- **Credit Logic**: Every student typically starts with **100 Credits**.
- **Automated Deductions**: Credits are automatically deducted based on infraction severity (e.g., Late Entry = -5 points).
- **Case Filing**:
  - Categories: Academic, IT Support, Administrative, Disciplinary.
  - Evidence: Support for ensuring photo proof is attached to cases.
- **Credit Reversal & Correction**:
  - **Delete Case**: Deleting a wrongly filed case **automatically refunds** the deducted points to the student.
  - **Manual Reset**: Admin override to reset a student's credits back to 100 (via long-press gesture on the credit badge).

### 4. **Activity Tracking**

- **My Reported Activity**: Tailored feed for staff.
  - **Faculty/Security**: See the cases you have reported.
